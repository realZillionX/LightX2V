# MiniMax-H3

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

MiniMax-H3 generates video with synchronized stereo audio. Run the commands below from the LightX2V repository root. Set `lightx2v_path` and `model_path` in the selected shell script before running it.

## Weights and tasks

Use the released Diffusers component layout under `model_path`:

```text
MiniMax-H3/
├── transformer/       # t2av, i2av, l2av, fl2av
├── transformer_ref/   # ref2av
├── text_encoder/
├── tokenizer/
├── processor/
├── vae/
└── audio_vae/
```

Each transformer directory needs its `config.json`, weight index, and checkpoint shards. Download the components for the task family you use; downloading only the original `FL2VA/` or `Ref2VA/` checkpoint directories does not provide this layout. FP8/INT8 presets still use the original component configs, tokenizer, and VAEs, and specify additional local quantized checkpoints in JSON.

| Task | Request inputs | Transformer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t2av` | `prompt` | `transformer` |
| `i2av` | `prompt`, `image_path` (first frame) | `transformer` |
| `l2av` | `prompt`, `last_frame_path` | `transformer` |
| `fl2av` | `prompt`, `image_path`, `last_frame_path` | `transformer` |
| `ref2av` | `prompt`, reference images and/or videos, optional reference audio | `transformer_ref` |

The base transformer can serve all four base tasks without reloading. Reference generation uses a separate transformer and service. These checkpoints are CFG-distilled: do not send `negative_prompt`, including an empty string.

Set `--model-variant` explicitly at startup: `fl2av` loads `transformer` and supports `t2av`, `i2av`, `l2av`, and `fl2av`; `ref2av` loads `transformer_ref` and supports `ref2av`. There is no default variant. Requests select `task` within the loaded variant. Both variants can use the same inference JSON; choose a matching LoRA or quantized checkpoint when those features are enabled.

## AdaLN cache

MiniMax-H3 CPU offload requires `use_adaln_cache: true`. Before starting inference, generate the persistent cache with the same model, config, inference-step count, and flow shifts that inference will use:

```bash
bash tools/cache_minimax_h3_adaln/run_cache_minimax_h3_adaln.sh
```

Set `lightx2v_path`, `model_path`, `--config_json`, and `--model-variant` in the script before running it. `--model-variant fl2av` creates both base-transformer profiles and serves `t2av`, `i2av`, `l2av`, and `fl2av`. Run the script separately with `--model-variant ref2av` to build the reference-transformer cache. Every JSON config with `use_adaln_cache: true` must explicitly set `adaln_cache_dir`; the bundled configs use `~/.cache/lightx2v/adaln`. Final directory names include the variant, inference-step count, and video/audio flow shifts, such as `minimax_h3/fl2av_29steps_shift_12.0_3.0`, `minimax_h3/fl2av_04steps_shift_6.0_3.0`, or `minimax_h3/ref2av_29steps_shift_12.0_3.0`. Each `manifest.json` stores the minimal cache specification, which inference compares directly with its expected specification. Offline generation and inference read this same JSON setting. Cache generation refuses to overwrite an existing target directory. Inference loads a matching cache strictly and does not fall back to online AdaLN computation.

## Offline inference

The five task scripts share `configs/minimax_h3/minimax_h3.json`: one GPU, BF16 weights, model CPU offload, and 124 frames at `[height, width] = [544, 960]`. The script's `--model-variant` selects the transformer; `--task` selects this request's input handling.

```bash
bash scripts/minimax_h3/run_minimax_h3_t2av.sh
bash scripts/minimax_h3/run_minimax_h3_i2av.sh
bash scripts/minimax_h3/run_minimax_h3_l2av.sh
bash scripts/minimax_h3/run_minimax_h3_fl2av.sh
bash scripts/minimax_h3/run_minimax_h3_ref2av.sh
```

The ordinary config uses SageAttention2 and SGL kernels. Select a config whose attention, quantization, and parallel settings match your installed kernels and devices. Paths, prompt, seed, and output path are visible in each script; each JSON remains a complete startup config.

To select another mode, change `--config_json` in the listed script to the corresponding file under `configs/minimax_h3/`. The single-GPU script also launches FP8, compile, and four-step LoRA modes; `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` provides a shared launcher for SP, TP, and mixed parallel configs. The table lists each preset's configured parallel sizes. In filenames, `encoder` refers to the text encoder and `vae` to the video VAE.

| `fp8/minimax_h3_sp_5090.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, 5090 FP8 config |

| `dmd/minimax_h3_int8_4step.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP4, INT8 + 4-step LoRA |
| `dmd/minimax_h3_fp8_8step.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, FP8 + 8-step LoRA |
| `dmd/minimax_h3_int8_convrot_8step.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, INT8 ConvRot + 8-step LoRA |
| `dmd/minimax_h3_fp8_4step_5090.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, 5090, 4-step LoRA |
| `dmd/minimax_h3_fp8_4step_5090_vae_fp8.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, FP8 VAE + 4-step LoRA |
| `dmd/minimax_h3_fp8_4step_5090_vae_fp8_sla.json` | `run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` | SP8, FP8 VAE Encoder/Decoder + matching SLA LoRA |

| `dmd/minimax_h3_ref2av_4step.json` | `run_minimax_h3_ref2av.sh`, with 8 processes as described below | Reference-task 4-step LoRA |

`run_minimax_h3_t2av_parallel.sh` defaults to SP4. To select another parallel preset, change `--config_json` and keep `torchrun --nproc_per_node` and `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` consistent with the JSON. The process count is `tensor_p_size × seq_p_size` for these presets; an omitted parallel size is 1.

| Parallel mode in the selected JSON | `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | `--nproc_per_node` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TP2 | `0,1` | `2` |
| SP4 or TP2 × SP2 | `0,1,2,3` | `4` |
| SP8, including the 5090 presets | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` | `8` |

For the 8-GPU reference LoRA config, set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` in `run_minimax_h3_ref2av.sh` and replace `python -m lightx2v.infer` with `torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m lightx2v.infer`. Keep its `--model-variant ref2av`, `--task ref2av`, and reference input arguments.

Both single-GPU Sol configs default to 362 frames at `[768, 1344]`. Select the corresponding Sol JSON through `--config_json` in `run_minimax_h3_t2av.sh` to use these output defaults.

All MiniMax-H3 configs that enable compilation also set `warmup: true`. The ordinary and compile configs share the same output defaults and can be used by both service launch scripts as well.

Video VAE Encoder acceleration is selected through startup JSON `vae_encoder_conv_mode`; it applies to `i2av`,
`l2av`, `fl2av`, and `ref2av`, which encode input images or videos. `t2av` does not run this encoder. The default
is `torch`; `torch_channels_last` uses the original weights, while FP8 modes require converted Encoder weights
and SM120. Select the same JSON through the existing CLI, Python, or service entry point. See the
[conversion and runtime settings](../../docs/EN/source/method_tutorials/quantization.md#minimax-h3-video-vae-encoder-conv3d).

### Video encoding

To reproduce the 362-frame output encoder example, update these fields in a copy of `minimax_h3.json` and point the launch script at that complete JSON:

```json
{
  "num_frames": 362,
  "video_codec_options": {
    "preset": "ultrafast",
    "crf": "18"
  }
}
```

`video_codec_options` is a startup setting consumed by the existing MP4 encoder. Other dimensions and frame counts remain request overrides; no separate config is needed for each output shape.

## LoRA and Python

Replace `/path/to/...` in every selected quantized checkpoint and LoRA field with an existing local file. The loader does not download LoRAs from a repository ID. Use a LoRA for the correct task family and keep `alpha` consistent with that checkpoint's training configuration; do not interchange base, reference, SLA, or differently versioned LoRAs merely because their shapes match.

The named base 4-step v1.0 LoRA uses `alpha=128`, `video_flow_shift=6`, and `audio_flow_shift=3`. Other presets retain their own alpha and shift settings.

Choose `lora_dynamic_apply` in the selected JSON according to the DiT weights:

| DiT weights | Supported setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original BF16 | `false` or `true` | `false` merges the adapter when loading weights; `true` applies it during inference. |
| Quantized FP8 or INT8, including ConvRot | `true` | Apply the adapter during inference; merging into quantized DiT weights is unsupported. |

Quantizing only the encoder or VAE does not impose this restriction. Dynamic LoRA currently accepts one adapter and requires its `alpha` to be explicitly configured. The existing model loader rejects unsupported combinations.

The shared `dmd/minimax_h3_bf16_4step.json` defaults to `lora_dynamic_apply: true`, with 362 frames at `[768, 1344]`. Set the same field to `false` to use merging. Select this JSON in `run_minimax_h3_t2av.sh`; for a shorter, smaller output, add `--size 544 960` and `--num_frames 124` to its inference command.

Set `infer_steps` in JSON to the number of model evaluations: `4` for 4-step inference and `8` for 8-step inference. The scheduler includes the terminal zero automatically. When migrating an older MiniMax-H3 config, subtract one from its `infer_steps` value (`5` → `4`, `9` → `8`, `30` → `29`) to preserve the original sampling schedule. The bundled configs already use this convention.

In Python, pass `model_variant="fl2av"` or `"ref2av"` to `LightX2VPipeline`, and select `task` in `generate()`.

For Python, set `MODEL_PATH` in [the example](../../examples/minimax_h3/minimax_h3_t2av_dmd.py) and the local LoRA path in its selected JSON, then run:

```bash
python examples/minimax_h3/minimax_h3_t2av_dmd.py
```

## Server and POST

The base service starts with `--model-variant fl2av` and no startup `--task`. Start it, then submit a request from another terminal:

```bash
bash scripts/minimax_h3/server/start_server.sh
```

```bash
python scripts/minimax_h3/server/post_t2av.py
python scripts/minimax_h3/server/post_i2av.py
python scripts/minimax_h3/server/post_l2av.py
python scripts/minimax_h3/server/post_fl2av.py
```

Each base request must specify `task`, because the loaded transformer supports four tasks. The image examples encode client-local files as Base64.

For reference generation, start the service with `--model-variant ref2av`:

```bash
bash scripts/minimax_h3/server/start_server_ref2av.sh
```

```bash
python scripts/minimax_h3/server/post_ref2av.py
```

Both launch scripts default to port 8000. To run both services simultaneously, choose separate GPUs, `--port`, and `--metric_port` values, and update the POST URLs. The reference service accepts only `ref2av`, so `task` may be omitted there; the example includes it for clarity.

Reference requests can supply `image_path`, `video_path`, and `audio_path` together. For multiple files of one kind, use comma-separated server-local paths, for example:

```json
{
  "task": "ref2av",
  "prompt": "Generate an audio-video scene following the references.",
  "image_path": "/path/to/character.jpg,/path/to/scene.jpg",
  "video_path": "/path/to/motion.mp4",
  "audio_path": "/path/to/voice.wav",
  "seed": 42,
  "save_result_path": "./minimax_h3_references.mp4"
}
```

Audio must be accompanied by an image or video. The runner accepts at most 9 images, 3 videos, and 12 references in total; the audio-reference limit is 3, including video soundtracks. Single image inputs also accept Base64 and HTTP(S) URLs; input videos use server-local paths. The default reference-image preprocessing follows the released Diffusers sizing; `reference_image_resize_mode: "match"` in JSON is an explicit alternative that limits reference-image area to the output canvas.

POST returns a task ID before inference completes. Query status, then download the completed result:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks/TASK_ID/status
curl --fail http://localhost:8000/v1/tasks/TASK_ID/result -o minimax_h3.mp4
```

Use a relative path such as `./minimax_h3_t2av.mp4` for `save_result_path`; the service resolves it relative to its output directory and can return it through the download endpoint. Omitting the path or sending `null` skips saving; that request has no downloadable result.

## Request and startup settings

- Startup: model paths, model variant, weights/LoRA, kernels, offload, parallelism, compile, and warmup. Prompt, media paths, seed, and output path belong in the Python call, CLI command, or POST body.
- Output defaults: JSON sets `num_frames` and `size`. Requests can override them with `num_frames` and `size` (`[height, width]`). Dimensions must be multiples of 32. Frame counts align upward to `17*n+5`, with supported aligned counts from 124 to 362; for example, 125 becomes 141.
- Seed: omitted or `null` defaults to 42; an explicit non-negative value, including 0, is used as supplied.
- Saving: every CLI example explicitly provides an output path. Removing it skips file saving. The service follows the same rule. Output is MP4 with 24 FPS video and 32 kHz stereo audio.
